## Tiers of Play

### Tier 1 (Levels 1–4)

Characters are apprentice adventurers. They learn their starting class features and choose a subclass. Threats usually pose a danger to local farmsteads or villages.

### Tier 2 (Levels 5–10)

Characters are full-fledged adventurers. Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as *Fireball*, *Lightning Bolt*, and *Raise Dead*. Most weapon-focused classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in a round. Dangers threaten cities and kingdoms.

### Tier 3 (Levels 11–16)

Characters have reached a level of power that makes them special among adventurers. At level 11, many spellcasters learn reality-altering spells. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or to do more impressive things with those attacks. Threats to whole regions.

### Tier 4 (Levels 17–20)

Characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse might hang in the balance.

> ### Bonus Feats at Level 20
>
> A GM can use feats as a form of advancement after characters reach level 20 to provide greater power to characters who have no more levels to gain. With this approach, each character gains one feat of their choice for every 30,000 XP the character earns above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially appropriate for these bonus feats.

## Multiclassing

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes.

### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class and your current classes.

### Hit Points and Hit Point Dice

You gain the Hit Points from your new class as described for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit Points for a class only when your total character level is 1.

Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus

Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.

### Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting, and features that give you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.

#### Armor Class

If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor Class, you can benefit from only one at a time.

#### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than one class, the features don't stack. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless you have a feature that says you can (such as the Fighter's Two Extra Attacks feature).

Similarly, the Warlock's Thirsting Blade invocation doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

#### Spellcasting

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes.

**Spells Prepared.** You determine what spells you can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class.

**Cantrips.** If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.

**Spell Slots.** You determine your available spell slots by adding together the following:

- All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard classes
- Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and Ranger classes

Then look up this total level in the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

**Pact Magic.** If you have the Pact Magic feature from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic to cast spells you have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting feature, and vice versa.
