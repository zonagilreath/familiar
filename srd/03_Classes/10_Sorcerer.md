# Sorcerer

**Hit Die:** d6 | **Saves:** Constitution, Charisma | **Armor/Weapons:** Simple weapons, no armor

## Core Mechanics

**Innate Sorcery** (Bonus Action, 1 min, 2 uses/Long Rest): +1 spell save DC and Advantage on Sorcerer spell attack rolls. At level 7, can spend 2 Sorcery Points for an additional use. While active at level 7+, can apply two Metamagic options per spell. At level 20, one free Metamagic per turn while active.

**Sorcery Points** (= Sorcerer level, starting at level 2; recharge all on Long Rest):
- Convert spell slots to points (points = slot level)
- Create spell slots from points (cost: level 1 = 2 pts., level 2 = 3, level 3 = 5, level 4 = 6, level 5 = 7)
- Fuel Metamagic options

**Metamagic** (learn 2 at level 2, +2 at level 10, +2 at level 17):
- **Careful Spell** (1 pt.): CHA mod creatures auto-succeed on your spell's save, take no damage on half-damage success
- **Distant Spell** (1 pt.): Double spell range (5+ ft.) or make Touch spell 30 ft.
- **Empowered Spell** (1 pt.): Reroll up to CHA mod damage dice
- **Extended Spell** (1 pt.): Double duration (max 24 hrs), Advantage on Concentration saves
- **Heightened Spell** (2 pts.): One target has Disadvantage on save
- **Quickened Spell** (2 pts.): Change action casting time to Bonus Action
- **Seeking Spell** (1 pt.): Reroll missed spell attack (combinable with other Metamagic)
- **Subtle Spell** (1 pt.): No V/S/M components (except consumed/costly materials)
- **Transmuted Spell** (1 pt.): Change damage type among Acid/Cold/Fire/Lightning/Poison/Thunder
- **Twinned Spell** (1 pt.): Increase effective spell level by 1 (for spells that scale targets)

**Spellcasting:** Full caster (CHA). Standard full-caster spell slot progression.
