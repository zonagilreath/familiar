# Wizard

**Hit Die:** d6 | **Saves:** Intelligence, Wisdom | **Armor/Weapons:** Simple weapons, no armor

## Core Mechanics

**Spellcasting:** Full caster (INT). Prepares spells from a spellbook (starts with 6 level 1 spells, +2 per Wizard level). Can copy found spells into the book (2 hrs + 50 GP per spell level). Standard full-caster spell slot progression.

**Arcane Recovery** (Level 1, 1/Long Rest): On Short Rest, recover spell slots with combined levels up to half Wizard level (round up), none level 6+.

## Key Features by Level

- **Level 1:** Spellcasting, Ritual Adept (cast any Ritual-tagged spell from spellbook without preparing it), Arcane Recovery
- **Level 2:** Scholar (Expertise in one of Arcana/History/Investigation/Medicine/Nature/Religion)
- **Level 3:** Wizard Subclass
- **Level 5:** Memorize Spell -- swap one prepared spell on Short Rest
- **Level 18:** Spell Mastery -- choose one level 1 and one level 2 spell; cast them at lowest level without a slot at will
- **Level 20:** Signature Spells -- two level 3 spells always prepared; cast each once at level 3 without a slot (1/Short or Long Rest each)

## Subclasses (Level 3)

### Evoker
Blasting specialist with precision and power. Evocation Savant (Level 3) adds two free Evocation spells to the spellbook (+1 free per new spell level unlocked). Potent Cantrip (Level 3) causes damaging cantrips to deal half damage on a miss or successful save. Sculpt Spells (Level 6) lets 1 + spell level creatures auto-succeed on saves against your Evocation spells and take no damage (normally half on success). Empowered Evocation (Level 10) adds INT mod to one damage roll of Evocation spells. Overchannel (Level 14) maximizes damage on a level 1-5 spell; first use is free, subsequent uses before a Long Rest cost 2d12 Necrotic per spell level (increasing by 1d12 each additional use), ignoring Resistance/Immunity.
