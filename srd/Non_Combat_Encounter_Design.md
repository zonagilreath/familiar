# Non-Combat Encounter Design: System Context Document

## Core Philosophy

Non-combat encounters exist to challenge players through creativity, problem-solving, social maneuvering, and exploration rather than through damage and hit points. The same principle that governs great combat applies here: **meaningful player choice is the atomic unit of fun**. A non-combat encounter fails when it reduces to a single die roll, locks out most of the party, or halts story progression on failure. Every non-combat encounter should allow all characters to participate, be tolerant of failed checks, and progress the story on both success and failure.

***

## Encounter Type Taxonomy

Non-combat encounters fall into eight broad categories. Most great encounters blend two or more types (e.g., a social encounter with an embedded puzzle, or an exploration scene that triggers a trap).

| Type | Core Loop | Primary Player Skills |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Puzzles** | Observe → Hypothesize → Test → Solve | Logic, lateral thinking, world knowledge |
| **Social / Roleplay** | Read NPC → Build argument → Persuade or deceive | Charisma skills, empathy, improvisation |
| **Skill Challenges** | Declare action → Roll → Narrate → Track progress | Diverse ability scores, teamwork |
| **Investigation / Mystery** | Gather clues → Connect dots → Reach conclusion | Perception, Investigation, deduction |
| **Traps** | Notice warning → Identify mechanism → Disarm or avoid | Perception, Thieves' Tools, creativity |
| **Exploration** | Observe environment → Choose direction → Discover | Survival, Nature, curiosity |
| **Chases** | Maintain pace → Overcome obstacles → Close/widen gap | Athletics, Acrobatics, Constitution |
| **Environmental Hazards** | Assess danger → Expend resources → Navigate safely | Varied skills, resource management |

## Puzzle Design

### What Makes Puzzles Fun

The best TTRPG puzzles engage the **players' real-world reasoning** while also letting characters contribute through skills and lore. Puzzles should feel native to the game world—fitting the genre, drawing on established lore, and having a logical reason for existing in the fiction.

### Design Principles

- **Multiple solutions.** Never design a puzzle with exactly one answer. Prepare one intended solution but accept any player proposal that is logical, satisfying, and fun. A single-solution puzzle risks grinding the session to a halt.
- **Blend player skill and character skill.** Players should do the thinking, but allow ability checks (Arcana, History, Investigation) to yield hints rather than bypass the puzzle entirely. Dice rolls should unlock clues, not skip the challenge.
- **Logical assumptions only.** If solving the puzzle requires an obscure leap of logic, the puzzle is flawed. Clues should point clearly toward the method and the solution. Players approach puzzles with logic; ambiguity breeds frustration.
- **Group participation.** The puzzle must be solvable by the table, not by one player. Design puzzles with multiple interactable elements, information spread across characters, or physical components that require coordination.
- **Fail-forward mechanics.** A failed puzzle should not block progression entirely. Failure might mean a resource cost (HP loss, spell slot expenditure, time pressure) or a harder path forward rather than a dead end.
- **Escalating stakes.** Add time pressure, environmental consequences, or narrative urgency so the puzzle isn't an isolated brain-teaser disconnected from the adventure.
- **Multi-step structure.** The best puzzles unfold over several steps—each step teaches a rule or reveals information needed for the next. This mirrors video game puzzle design where early rooms teach mechanics that later rooms combine in complex ways.

### Holistic Dungeon Design

A powerful technique is tying puzzles, combat, and exploration together through a single unifying mechanic or theme. For example, a dungeon built around colored lanterns that suppress specific schools of magic forces players to manage the mechanic across puzzle rooms, combat encounters, and navigation alike. When every element references the same core rules, the dungeon feels cohesive and each challenge trains players for the next.

### Puzzle Anti-Patterns

- Single solution with no flexibility
- Solvable by dice alone (roll Arcana to skip)
- Blocks all progress on failure
- Requires illogical leaps or obscure real-world knowledge
- Only one player can engage (everyone else watches)
- No stakes or consequences for failure
- Takes so long it dominates the session without payoff
- Genre-breaking (a sudoku grid in a medieval dungeon)
- One-action puzzles with no depth ("pull the lever")

***

## Social Encounters

### NPC Preparation Framework

Social encounters live or die on NPC design. Every NPC who might be the subject of a social encounter needs these defined in advance:

- **Goal**: What does the NPC want right now?
- **Objections**: Why would the NPC refuse the party's request?
- **Incentives**: What could the party offer that the NPC actually values?
- **Patience**: How long will the NPC entertain the conversation before disengaging?
- **Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws**: The DMG's social interaction rules hinge on these three traits. Players who discover and appeal to them shift the NPC's attitude; players who offend them push the NPC toward hostility.

### The Three-Phase Social System

The DMG contains an underused social encounter framework with three phases:

1. **Discovery.** Players roleplay with the NPC to learn their ideals, bonds, and flaws through observation and conversation. Alternatively, an Insight check can reveal a trait, but skipping roleplay means proceeding blind.
2. **Influence.** Players craft arguments that appeal to discovered traits. A good argument shifts the NPC's attitude one step friendlier; offending a trait shifts it one step hostile. Attitude can typically only shift once per interaction.
3. **Resolution.** With the NPC's attitude established, the player rolls a social skill check (Persuasion, Intimidation, Deception) against a DC set by the NPC's current attitude—typically DC 0 (friendly, auto-success), DC 10 (indifferent), or DC 20 (hostile).

### Social Encounter Design Principles

- **Reward roleplay, use dice as tiebreaker.** The quality of the player's argument should adjust the DC or grant advantage—not be irrelevant to the outcome. A brilliant argument with a low roll should still have weight.
- **Define what failure looks like beyond "no."** Failure in social combat should produce consequences: the NPC spreads rumors, raises prices, alerts guards, or offers a worse deal rather than simply refusing.
- **Avoid single-roll resolution for high-stakes moments.** Important social encounters deserve a multi-roll structure (social skill challenge or social combat system) rather than one Persuasion check deciding everything.
- **NPCs have agency.** NPCs should pursue their own goals during the conversation, not passively wait for players to persuade them. An NPC might try to extract information, stall for time, or manipulate the party in return.
- **Complicate the scene.** Add a ticking clock, a rival faction also negotiating, a spy eavesdropping, or an NPC bodyguard who changes the social dynamic. Complications prevent social encounters from becoming a flat "I roll Persuasion" exchange.
- **Goal → Conflict → Stakes framework.** Every roleplay encounter needs: what do the PCs want (Goal), why can't they just have it (Conflict), and what happens if they fail or succeed (Stakes). Without all three, the encounter lacks tension.

### Social Anti-Patterns

- Single Persuasion check resolves the entire encounter
- NPC has no defined personality, goals, or limits
- Charisma-based characters dominate while others watch
- "Nat 20 means the king gives you his kingdom"—no, the roll is bounded by the NPC's attitude and the plausibility of the request
- Insight check used as universal lie detector
- No consequences for failure—NPC just says "no" and the scene ends

***

## Skill Challenges

### Core Mechanic (4e Adapted for 5e)

Skill challenges provide a structured resolution framework for complex non-combat scenarios—chases, negotiations, heists, rituals, wilderness treks. The basic structure:

1. **Define the objective** and the fictional situation clearly.
2. **Set the success/failure threshold**: players must accumulate X successes before Y failures (e.g., 3 successes before 2 failures for a simple challenge; 5 before 3 for a complex one).
3. **Identify relevant skills** based on the scenario, but allow creative use of unexpected skills with good justification.
4. **Each player takes a turn**: describes their action, names a skill, and rolls. The DM narrates how success or failure changes the situation.
5. **Resolve**: Total successes vs. failures determines outcome—full success, partial success, or failure, each with distinct narrative consequences.

### Design Principles

- **Force creativity and teamwork.** The same skill should not be usable twice in a row (or at all, in stricter variants). This pushes players to think creatively about how their abilities apply.
- **Narrate every roll.** Each success and failure should visibly change the fiction. "You succeed on your Stealth check" is boring. "You press against the alley wall as the patrol passes inches away, their torchlight sliding across the cobblestones at your feet" makes the mechanic feel alive.
- **Scale complexity to stakes.** Low-stakes challenges: 3 successes before 2 failures. Medium: 4 before 3. High: 5 before 3. Adjust DCs similarly (DC 10–12 for relevant skills, DC 15+ for creative stretches).
- **Allow non-skill contributions.** Spellcasting, class features, tool proficiencies, and pure roleplay can count as automatic successes or grant advantage on the next roll.
- **Avoid metagaming the system.** Players should describe what their character does first, then determine the relevant skill—not announce "I use Athletics" and then justify it narratively.

### Skill Challenge Anti-Patterns

- Players gaming the system by always choosing their highest modifier
- DM narrates only pass/fail without changing the fictional situation
- No partial success option—binary win/lose feels punishing
- Challenge is trivially easy because all relevant skills match the party's strengths
- Single failure ends the entire challenge instead of building tension

## Investigation and Mystery Design

### The Three Clue Rule

The single most important principle in mystery design: **for any conclusion you want the PCs to reach, include at least three clues**.

The reasoning: players will miss the first clue, ignore the second, and misinterpret the third before making an unexpected logical leap that gets them where they need to go. Three clues provide redundancy so the mystery remains solvable even when players behave unpredictably.

- **Best case:** Players find all three clues and use them to confirm their theory, building satisfying certainty.
- **Worst case:** At least one clue reaches the players and keeps the adventure moving.
- **Permissive clue design:** Each clue should be independently sufficient to reach the conclusion. They are redundant paths, not puzzle pieces that only work in combination.

### Node-Based Mystery Structure

Extend the Three Clue Rule into a network: each "node" (location, NPC, event) contains three clues pointing to other nodes. This creates a web of interconnected leads rather than a linear trail. The underlying theory: three distinct options at each node provide sufficient redundancy to create a robust scenario, even if the PCs visit nodes in an unexpected order.

### Investigation Design Principles

- **Clues reward engagement, not rolls.** The GUMSHOE approach: if a player has the right skill and looks in the right place, they get the clue automatically—no roll required. The challenge is in interpreting and connecting clues, not in finding them. Failing to find a clue is never interesting or dramatic.
- **Require 2–3 complications per scene.** Each complication should use a different skill than the primary investigation skill, pulling more players into the scene.
- **Layer information.** Not all clues are equal. Some are obvious (free), some require effort (skill checks or resource expenditure), and some are hidden behind complications or social encounters.
- **Avoid the single-thread mystery.** If there is only one clue at each stage, a single missed roll or overlooked detail kills the entire scenario. The Three Clue Rule exists precisely to prevent this.

### Investigation Anti-Patterns

- Single-clue chokepoints where one failed Perception check stalls the mystery
- "Pixel hunting"—players must examine the exact right object to progress
- Clues that only make sense in retrospect, not when found
- Over-reliance on Investigation/Perception rolls instead of player reasoning
- Red herrings with no way to distinguish them from real clues (a few red herrings are fine if real clues outnumber them)

## Trap Design

### Why Most Traps Fail

Traditional trap design—hidden trap, Perception check to find it, saving throw to avoid damage—produces one of the least engaging moments in the game. Players make few meaningful choices; the trap is essentially a tax on hit points for failing a passive check. The "gotcha" model feels punitive rather than fun.

### The Four-Element Trap Framework

Good traps have four distinct components:

1. **Setting (Telegraphing).** The environment should hint that danger exists—scorch marks on walls, bones near a doorway, an unusually clean corridor. Players should have a chance to notice something is wrong before triggering the trap.
2. **Trigger.** What activates the trap? Pressure plates, tripwires, opening a door, speaking a word, removing an object. Design multiple possible triggers or allow players to identify and circumvent the trigger mechanism.
3. **Trap Mechanism.** The physical or magical system that makes the trap work—distinct from its consequence. A mechanism might be gears in the wall, a rune sequence, or a counterweight system. Understanding the mechanism gives players agency to disarm.
4. **Consequence.** What happens when the trap fires—damage, a locked room, an alarm, poison, or a change to the environment (flooding, collapsing ceiling). Consequences should be interesting, not just "take 2d6 damage".

### The Click Rule

When a trap triggers, describe the activation moment ("you hear a click as the stone depresses under your foot") and then **ask the player what they do**. Resolve the consequence based on the quality and speed of their response. This transforms traps from passive punishment into active decision-making moments. The player's choice matters more than a saving throw.

### Trap Design Principles

- **Telegraph the danger.** Players should always have a fair chance to notice warning signs before a trap triggers. "Gotcha" traps where there was no possible way to detect them feel like DM cheating.
- **Make disarming interesting.** Disarming shouldn't be a single Thieves' Tools check. Give the trap a mechanism that players can interact with in multiple ways—brute force, magic, clever use of environment, or actual disassembly.
- **Traps as encounters, not speed bumps.** The best traps combine with other elements: a trap in a combat arena, a trapped puzzle, or a social encounter where an NPC threatens to trigger a trap.
- **Traps drain resources, not just HP.** A trap that costs a spell slot to bypass, forces a long route, triggers an alarm, or separates the party is more interesting than one that simply deals damage.

### Trap Anti-Patterns

- No warning signs, no chance to detect before triggering
- Single Perception check to find + single save to avoid = the entire interaction
- Damage is the only consequence
- Trap has no mechanism players can understand or interact with
- "Save or die" traps with no counterplay
- Traps that punish careful players (trap triggers on Investigation)

## Exploration Encounters

### The Curiosity Loop

Great exploration design follows a psychological loop borrowed from open-world game design:

1. **Visual Beacon.** Something in the distance catches attention—a light, a structure, an anomaly. This is the hook.
2. **Journey.** Getting there involves traversal challenges, minor discoveries, and environmental storytelling.
3. **Discovery.** Reaching the beacon reveals something meaningful—lore, treasure, a new lead, or a new beacon on the horizon.
4. **Reward Anticipation.** The discovery creates desire for more, restarting the loop.

The key insight: exploration is driven by **player curiosity, not quest logs**. The environment should invite investigation through visual and narrative intrigue rather than explicit instructions to "go here."

### Exploration Design Principles

- **Reward investigation.** Every interesting-looking feature should yield something when examined—lore, a minor item, environmental information, or a clue. Empty rooms and fruitless searches train players to stop exploring.
- **Environmental storytelling.** Let the environment communicate narrative through details: a half-eaten meal, claw marks on a door, a child's toy in a dungeon cell. Players piece together what happened without being told.
- **Player-driven discovery.** Avoid narrating discoveries at players. Present the environment and let players choose what to investigate. "You enter a chamber with a cracked mosaic floor, a dry fountain, and a door covered in scratches" gives three hooks—the players decide which matters.
- **Balance mystery with clarity.** Players need enough information to make meaningful choices about where to go and what to investigate, but not so much that there's nothing left to discover.
- **Multiple paths.** Exploration-heavy areas should offer routing choices with different risk/reward profiles—the safe but long path, the dangerous shortcut, the hidden passage that requires a check to find.

***

## Chase Encounters

### Mechanical Framework

D&D 5e provides a chase mechanic with these core rules:

- **Initiative.** All participants roll initiative; only one action and one move per turn. Bonus actions and reactions are not permitted, streamlining the scene.
- **Dash limits.** Participants can Dash freely a number of times equal to 3 + Constitution modifier. Each additional Dash requires a DC 10 Constitution check or the character gains a level of exhaustion. At exhaustion level 5 (speed drops to 0), the character drops out.
- **Complications.** Every chase participant rolls a d20 at the end of their turn to determine if a complication occurs. Complications are the primary source of tension—overturned carts, crowded markets, crumbling terrain, sudden drops.

### Chase Design Principles

- **Keep chases short.** 3–6 rounds is the ideal length. Longer chases lose urgency and become tedious.
- **Complications drive the drama.** The complication table is more important than the raw mechanics. Each complication should force a meaningful choice: do you leap the gap (Athletics) or find another way around (losing ground)?
- **Use Theater of the Mind.** Chases cover large distances that don't map well to battle grids. Describe the scene cinematically and track relative distance abstractly.
- **Vary the complication skills.** Require Athletics, Acrobatics, Perception, and other checks across different complications so the whole party contributes.
- **Define win/loss conditions clearly.** What happens if they catch the quarry? What happens if they lose them? Both outcomes should advance the story.

***

## Environmental Hazards and Resource Drains

Environmental hazards function as non-combat pressure that depletes party resources—hit points, spell slots, consumables, time—without requiring initiative rolls. They work best as elements layered into other encounter types rather than standalone challenges.

### Design Principles

- **Require 2–3 different skills to navigate.** If the hazard only requires one type of check, only one character matters. Vary the skills so the party must cooperate.
- **Create resource tension.** The value of a hazard is making the party spend resources before or between combats. Healing spells used on lava burns aren't available for the boss fight.
- **Offer choices, not just checks.** "The bridge is collapsing; do you sprint across (Athletics DC 15, risk of falling) or look for another route (Survival DC 12, costs 30 minutes)?" is better than "make an Athletics check."
- **Encounter conversion.** A failed hazard can convert into a different encounter type—a failed stealth section becomes a combat; a failed climb becomes a chase; a failed negotiation becomes an escape. This fail-forward approach keeps the game moving.

***

## Universal Design Principles

These principles apply across all non-combat encounter types:

### Participation

Every encounter should offer meaningful actions for at least three-quarters of the party. If only the Rogue can contribute to a trap, or only the Bard matters in a social scene, the encounter is poorly designed. Use varied skill requirements, physical and mental challenges in the same encounter, and opportunities for creative problem-solving that don't depend on specific class features.

### Fail Forward

Failure should never mean "nothing happens" or "the game stops". Failure creates consequences: the situation gets worse, a new complication arises, the party succeeds but at a cost, or the encounter converts into a different type. The story always progresses.

### Multiple Solutions

For any challenge, there should be at least two viable approaches and ideally three or more. A locked door can be picked, broken down, bypassed through a window, or avoided entirely by finding another route. When players find a creative solution not on the list, reward it if it's plausible.

### Meaningful Choice

The player's decision should matter more than the die roll. Choices should have observable consequences, trade-offs, and should reflect the character's abilities and the player's reasoning. If the encounter resolves to "roll a skill check and I'll tell you what happens," it lacks agency.

### Narrative Integration

Non-combat encounters should advance the story, reveal character, or change the game state. A puzzle that exists only to be solved, with no narrative connection to the adventure, feels like filler. Every encounter should answer the question: "Why does this matter to the story?"

### Victory Points / Progress Tracking

For any non-combat encounter that takes more than one round, use some form of progress tracking—victory points, success counts, attitude shifts, distance closed. This gives players a visible sense of momentum and helps the DM pace the encounter. The equivalent of "hit points" for non-combat encounters, progress tracking transforms abstract challenges into tangible ones.

***

## Encounter Conversion Table

One of the most powerful techniques is allowing encounters to convert into different types based on player choices or failures:

| Original Encounter | On Failure/Escalation | Conversion Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Stealth/Infiltration | → Combat or Chase | Detection by enemies |
| Social Negotiation | → Combat or Stealth | NPC patience exhausted, insult given |
| Combat | → Chase or Social | Party retreating or enemy surrendering |
| Puzzle | → Trap or Combat | Timer expires or wrong solution triggers defense |
| Investigation | → Social or Combat | Suspect confronted or evidence leads to ambush |
| Chase | → Combat or Social | Quarry cornered or party caught |
| Trap | → Combat or Puzzle | Trap triggers alarm or partial disarm reveals deeper mechanism |
| Exploration | → Any type | Discovery leads to whatever awaits |

This approach ensures that "failure" never means the game stops—it means the game changes.

## Quality Checklist

Before running any non-combat encounter, verify:

- [ ] **Participation**: Can at least 3 of 4 party members contribute meaningfully?
- [ ] **Failure State**: Does failure advance the story rather than halt it?
- [ ] **Multiple Solutions**: Are there at least 2 viable approaches?
- [ ] **Player Agency**: Do players make meaningful choices beyond "roll a check"?
- [ ] **Stakes**: Are consequences for success and failure defined and interesting?
- [ ] **Narrative Fit**: Does the encounter connect to the adventure's story?
- [ ] **Skill Variety**: Does the encounter use at least 2–3 different skills or abilities?
- [ ] **Pacing**: Will the encounter take an appropriate amount of table time relative to its importance?
- [ ] **Conversion Path**: If the encounter fails or escalates, what does it become?
- [ ] **Progress Tracking**: For multi-round encounters, is there a visible progress mechanic?
